# Asterion: Read & Tip Novels on Farcaster

Asterion is a Farcaster mini app that lets users read web novels for free and tip authors directlyâ€”on-chain, transparently, and with creator-first economics. Built for the Zora Coinathon, Asterion reimagines the web novel experience by leveraging Zora v4 coins, wallet-based tipping, and deep Farcaster integration.

## Motivation

Current web novel platforms are expensive for readers, restrictive for authors, and lack transparency:

- Reading a full novel can cost $300+
- App stores and platforms take large revenue cuts (up to 80%+)
- Authors are locked into daily publishing contracts, often at the expense of quality

Asterion solves these problems by making every novel a Zora v4 coin, enabling direct, transparent tipping, and giving authors more freedom and a larger share of earnings.

## Key Features

- **Read Novels for Free:** Browse and read novels directly in the app.
- **Zora v4 Coin for Each Novel:** Every novel is a Zora v4 coin, enabling on-chain tipping and ownership.
- **Wallet-Based Tipping:** Users tip authors by sending a "love" reaction to chapters, using their in-app wallet.
- **Supporters Tab:** Each novel displays its top 100 supporters, with perks for major supporters.
- **Clip Sharing:** Capture and share clips from chapters directly to the Farcaster feed.
- **Notifications:** Get notified when new chapters are released for your favorite novels.
- **In-App Reading Tools:** Enhanced reading experience with built-in tools.
