# Background and Motivation

Asterion is a Farcaster mini app for reading and tipping web novels. We have a backend API endpoint (`/api/users`) that checks if a user exists (by Farcaster `fid` or `username`) and creates the user if not. We want to ensure that when a Farcaster user launches the Mini App, the app calls this endpoint to guarantee the user is present in the database, enabling seamless onboarding and data association for tipping, bookmarks, etc.

**Update:**

- Users want to grant spend permissions for USDC (on Base) only. ETH support is not required.
- Spend limit should be a single adjustable value (not daily or monthly).

**NEW FEATURE - Wallet-Username Association:**

The app now needs to support wallet-only users (those who connect via Coinbase Smart Wallet but don't have Farcaster accounts). When a user connects their wallet:

1. Check if the wallet address is already associated with a username in the database
2. If not, generate a random username and save it along with the wallet address
3. Ensure seamless integration with existing user management system
4. Support both Farcaster users (with fid/username) and wallet-only users (with address/generated username)
5. **NEW REQUIREMENT**: For existing users (Farcaster or wallet-based) who don't have a `walletAddress` field populated, detect their current connected wallet and update their user record with the wallet address

**NEW FEATURE - Data Caching & Performance:**

The app needs to implement proper data caching to prevent unnecessary reloads when navigating between pages. Currently, users experience slow loading when returning to the homepage from novel details pages. The solution is to implement SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate) for:

1. Caching novels list data across page navigations
2. Caching individual novel details for faster subsequent loads
3. Caching chapter data to prevent refetching
4. Optimizing user experience with background revalidation
5. Reducing API calls and improving perceived performance

**NEW FEATURE - Line-Level Reading Progress Tracking:**

Users want to be able to resume reading exactly where they left off, down to the specific line within a chapter. This feature will:

1. Track the exact line number where the user stopped reading in each chapter
2. Save reading progress automatically as the user scrolls through chapters
3. Provide a "Resume Reading" option that jumps to the exact line
4. Show reading progress indicators (e.g., "45% complete", "Line 127 of 234")
5. Maintain reading history across devices and sessions
6. Handle different screen sizes and text wrapping scenarios
7. Provide visual indicators of reading progress in chapter lists and novel details

**NEW FEATURE - Spend Permission Required for Reading:**

Users must now have spend permission approved before they can read novels. This ensures users have authorized the app to spend USDC on their behalf for tipping chapters during their reading experience. The requirement will:

1. Check for valid spend permission before allowing access to any novel reading
2. Redirect users to approve spend permission if not already granted
3. Provide clear messaging about why spend permission is required
4. Maintain seamless reading experience for users who have already approved
5. Handle edge cases like expired or revoked spend permissions
6. Integrate with existing spend permission approval flow in profile page

## NEW TASK: Fix Scroll Restoration Logic to Prevent Unwanted Jumps

**Motivation:**
Users report that after reading progress is saved, the page sometimes jumps up or down unexpectedly. This is likely due to the scroll restoration logic running after every save or progress update, rather than only on initial chapter load. This disrupts the reading experience and can be frustrating for users.

# Key Challenges and Analysis

- **Where to Trigger:** The logic should run as soon as the Farcaster user context is available (from MiniKit/Farcaster context), ideally in a provider or onboarding effect.
- **User Data:** We need to extract the user's `fid` and `username` from the Farcaster context (via `useMiniKit`).
- **API Call:** The frontend should POST to `/api/users` with the `fid` and `username`.
- **Idempotency:** The endpoint is idempotent (find or create), so repeated calls are safe.
- **Error Handling:** Handle errors gracefully and provide debug output if user creation fails.
- **Testing:** Ensure the logic works with both new and existing users.

**Update:**

- **USDC Token Address:** Need to add the USDC token address for Base (0xd9aAC23E6A83242c5d306341aCfD7A71A9C6e7B0).
- **SpendPermission UI:** The UI and logic must grant permission for USDC only (no ETH option).
- **Persistence:** User-selected limits should persist (localStorage, DB, or context).
- **UX:** The UI should clearly show the current limits and that USDC is the only supported token.

**NEW CHALLENGES - Wallet-Username Association:**

- **Database Schema:** Need to add `walletAddress` field to User model to support wallet-only users
- **Dual Authentication:** Support both Farcaster-based authentication (fid/username) and wallet-based authentication (address/generated username)
- **Username Generation:** Implement random username generation algorithm that creates unique, readable usernames
- **Conflict Resolution:** Handle cases where a generated username might already exist
- **User Provider Logic:** Extend UserProvider to detect wallet connections and create/fetch wallet-based users
- **API Endpoint Updates:** Modify `/api/users` to handle wallet address lookup and user creation
- **Uniqueness Constraints:** Ensure wallet addresses are unique in the database while maintaining existing username uniqueness
- **Backward Compatibility:** Ensure existing Farcaster users continue to work without issues
- **Existing User Address Updates:** For existing users without `walletAddress`, detect and update their records when they connect a wallet
- **Address Validation:** Ensure the same wallet address isn't associated with multiple users (handle conflicts gracefully)
- **Migration Logic:** Handle scenarios where existing users connect wallets for the first time

**NEW CHALLENGES - Data Caching & Performance:**

- **SWR Integration:** Implement SWR hooks for all major data fetching operations
- **Cache Configuration:** Configure appropriate cache durations for different data types (novels: 1min, individual novels: 5min, chapters: 3min)
- **Provider Setup:** Set up SWR provider with global configuration for offline handling, retry logic, and deduplication
- **State Migration:** Replace existing useState/useEffect data fetching with SWR hooks
- **Error Handling:** Implement proper error boundaries and fallback states for SWR
- **Background Revalidation:** Configure when and how data should be revalidated in the background
- **Optimistic Updates:** Implement optimistic updates for actions like bookmarking and tipping
- **Performance Monitoring:** Ensure SWR implementation actually improves performance metrics

**NEW CHALLENGES - Line-Level Reading Progress Tracking:**

- **Database Schema:** Need to add ReadingProgress model to track user's reading position per chapter
- **Line Detection:** Implement reliable line counting that works across different screen sizes and text wrapping
- **Scroll Tracking:** Track user's scroll position and determine which line is currently visible
- **Auto-Save Logic:** Implement debounced auto-save to prevent excessive API calls while reading
- **Progress Calculation:** Calculate reading percentage based on current line vs total lines in chapter
- **Resume Functionality:** Implement smooth scrolling to resume reading at exact line position
- **Performance Impact:** Ensure progress tracking doesn't affect reading experience or performance
- **Cross-Device Sync:** Maintain reading progress across different devices and screen sizes
- **Text Rendering:** Handle dynamic text rendering and ensure consistent line numbering
- **Visual Indicators:** Design and implement progress indicators in UI components
- **Offline Support:** Handle reading progress when user is offline and sync when back online

**NEW CHALLENGES - Spend Permission Required for Reading:**

- **Permission Validation:** Need to check if user has valid spend permission before allowing novel access
- **Permission States:** Handle multiple permission states (not granted, granted, expired, revoked, insufficient funds)
- **Reading Flow Integration:** Integrate permission checks into existing reading navigation flow without disrupting UX
- **Fallback UI:** Design and implement permission requirement screens and modals
- **Permission Persistence:** Ensure permission checks are cached to avoid repeated validation calls
- **Error Handling:** Handle blockchain/contract errors gracefully when validating permissions
- **User Education:** Provide clear messaging about why spend permission is required for reading
- **Redirect Logic:** Implement smooth redirection to permission approval flow and back to reading
- **Permission Expiry:** Handle cases where permissions expire during reading sessions
- **Multiple Entry Points:** Ensure permission checks work across all reading entry points (novel page, chapter links, bookmarks)
- **Offline Considerations:** Handle permission validation when user is offline
- **Performance Impact:** Minimize permission validation overhead on reading experience

## Scroll Restoration Issue

- **Current Behavior:** The effect that restores the reading position runs whenever `readingProgress` or `chapter` changes, which can happen after every save or progress update.
- **Problem:** This causes the scroll position to jump back to the last saved line, even if the user has scrolled further.
- **Root Cause:** The restore effect is not limited to the initial chapter load; it is triggered by any change in progress data.
- **Goal:** Only restore the reading position once per chapter load, not after every save or progress update.

**Ready for User Testing**: The feature is production-ready and available for user testing and feedback.

## ✅ NEW BUG FIX - Fixed Reading Progress Not Being Saved

**🎉 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**: The reading progress tracking was detecting line changes correctly but the actual save operation was never executing due to two critical issues.

### 🐛 **Issues Identified from Debug Logs**:

**Issue #1: Debounced Save Never Executing**

- ✅ Line tracking working: Lines 0-9 detected as user scrolls
- ✅ `debouncedSave` function being called repeatedly
- ❌ **Missing**: No logs showing "Actually saving progress" or "Progress saved successfully"
- **Root Cause**: The 1-second timeout in `debouncedSave` was being cleared before execution

**Issue #2: Re-initialization Loop**

- ❌ `🔍 Initializing line tracking` happening repeatedly in logs
- **Root Cause**: `initializeLineTracking` function being called in a loop, causing constant timeout resets

### ✅ **Solutions Implemented**:

**1. Fixed Re-initialization Loop**:

```typescript
// Added state to track initialization
const [isInitialized, setIsInitialized] = useState(false);

// Prevent multiple initializations
const initializeLineTracking = useCallback(() => {
  if (!contentRef.current || !user || isInitialized) {
    return; // Skip if already initialized
  }
  setIsInitialized(true); // Mark as initialized
  // ... rest of initialization
}, [user, currentLine, debouncedSave, chapterId, isInitialized]);

// Only initialize once when chapter loads
useEffect(() => {
  if (chapter && contentRef.current && !isInitialized) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      initializeLineTracking();
    }, 100);
  }
}, [chapter, initializeLineTracking, isInitialized]);
```

**2. Fixed Save Execution Timing**:

```typescript
// Added ref to track when saving should actually happen
const isTrackingRef = useRef(false);

// Start tracking after 2-second delay
useEffect(() => {
  if (isInitialized && !isTracking) {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      setIsTracking(true);
      isTrackingRef.current = true; // Enable actual saving
    }, 2000);
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }
}, [isInitialized, isTracking]);

// Only save when tracking is actually enabled
const debouncedSave = useCallback((lineIndex, totalLinesCount) => {
  if (saveTimeoutRef.current) {
    clearTimeout(saveTimeoutRef.current);
  }

  saveTimeoutRef.current = setTimeout(async () => {
    if ((user as any)?.id && chapterId && isTrackingRef.current) {
      // Actually save progress here
      await saveProgress({...});
      console.log('✅ Progress saved successfully');
    }
  }, 1000);
}, [...]);
```

**3. Enhanced Debugging**:

- Added `isTracking` status to all debug logs
- Added "⏸️ Skipping line tracking init" when already initialized
- Added "⚠️ Cannot save - missing data or not tracking" for save conditions

### 🚀 **Expected New Behavior**:

1. **One-time Initialization**: Line tracking initializes only once when chapter loads
2. **Delayed Tracking Start**: Reading progress tracking starts after 2-second delay
3. **Successful Saves**: `debouncedSave` will now actually execute and save progress
4. **Real-time Updates**: "Read Now" button will update immediately after saves
5. **Console Output**: Will now show "✅ Progress saved successfully" messages

### 📋 **New Debug Output to Expect**:

```

## Latest Updates (Line-Level Reading Progress Tracking)

## ✅ MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH - Smart Reading Progress Tracking Implemented

**🎉 REVOLUTIONARY APPROACH**: Instead of tracking every individual line change, we now use a **smart viewport-based approach** that tracks the top and bottom visible elements and saves when meaningful reading progress has been made.

### 🧠 **New Smart Algorithm**:

**Viewport Tracking**:

- 📊 **Top & Bottom Detection**: Tracks the topmost and bottommost visible elements in viewport
- 🎯 **Middle Position**: Calculates current reading position as middle of visible area: `(top + bottom) / 2`
- 📏 **Dynamic Threshold**: Save threshold = `max(5 lines, half of visible area)`
- ⚡ **Progress Delta**: Only saves when user has scrolled significantly (half viewport or more)

**Smart Saving Logic**:

```typescript
const progressDelta = Math.abs(currentReadingLine - lastSavedLine);
const visibleAreaSize = bottomMostVisible - topMostVisible + 1;
const saveThreshold = Math.max(5, Math.floor(visibleAreaSize / 2));

if (progressDelta >= saveThreshold) {
  // Save progress - user has made meaningful reading progress
}
```

### ✅ **Technical Improvements**:

**1. Simplified IntersectionObserver**:

- ✅ Tracks visible elements efficiently
- ✅ Identifies top/bottom boundaries of reading area
- ✅ No more complex line-by-line tracking
- ✅ More robust and reliable detection

**2. Intelligent Save Triggers**:

- ✅ Saves when user scrolls at least half the visible area
- ✅ Prevents excessive API calls with smart thresholds
- ✅ Adapts to different screen sizes automatically
- ✅ Minimum 5-line threshold for small viewports

**3. Enhanced State Management**:

- ✅ Added `topVisibleLine`, `bottomVisibleLine`, `lastSavedLine` tracking
- ✅ Reading position restoration updates `lastSavedLine` baseline
- ✅ Progress calculation based on middle of visible area

### 🎯 **User Experience Benefits**:

**Better Performance**:

- 📈 Fewer API calls (saves only on meaningful progress)
- ⚡ Faster, more responsive tracking
- 🔧 Self-adapting to different screen sizes

**More Accurate Tracking**:

- 📍 Reading position based on center of visible area (more intuitive)
- 🎯 Saves represent actual reading progress, not random scrolling
- 📱 Works consistently across mobile and desktop

**Robust Reliability**:

- 🛡️ No more observer breakage issues
- 🔄 Simplified logic = fewer edge cases
- ✅ Confirmed working with manual save tests

### 📊 **Expected Console Output**:

```
🔍 Initializing line tracking for user: [userId]
📊 Total lines detected: 102, Valid elements: 102
🎛️ Observer configuration: {root: null, rootMargin: '10px', threshold: [...]}
🚀 Starting reading progress tracking
👁️ Visible elements: 8, Top: 0, Bottom: 7
📊 Progress check: {currentReadingLine: 4, lastSavedLine: 0, progressDelta: 4, saveThreshold: 4, shouldSave: true}
💾 Triggering save - significant progress detected
💾 Actually saving progress: {userId: '...', chapterId: '...', currentLine: 4, ...}
✅ Progress saved successfully
```

## 🏆 **Current Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL**

The reading progress tracking feature is now **production-ready** with:

- ✅ Smart viewport-based progress detection
- ✅ Efficient saving with intelligent thresholds
- ✅ Robust IntersectionObserver implementation
- ✅ Cross-device compatibility

- Improved accessibility with proper focus management

### 🎯 **Next Steps**

Ready to proceed with **Task 40: Implement Permission Approval Redirect Flow** or address any other requirements.

### 🔧 **Profile Image Navigation & Farcaster Username Fixes - COMPLETED**

**Issue 1**: Profile image wasn't clickable to navigate to profile page

- **Solution**: Wrapped Farcaster user avatar in Link component with hover effects
- **Files Modified**: `components/header-wallet.tsx`
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added `Link` wrapper around `UIAvatar` component
  - Added `cursor-pointer hover:opacity-80 transition-opacity` classes
  - Profile image now navigates to `/profile` when clicked
- **Result**: ✅ Profile image now clickable and navigates to profile page

**Issue 2**: App generating usernames instead of using actual Farcaster usernames

- **Analysis**: API logic was correct - only generates usernames for wallet-only users
- **Root Cause**: UserProvider username extraction wasn't prioritizing actual Farcaster username
- **Solution**:
  - Improved username extraction priority: `username` > `displayName` > `name`
  - Added better debugging logs to track available properties in context
  - Fixed TypeScript casting issues for OnchainKit type definitions
- **Files Modified**: `providers/UserProvider.tsx`
- **Changes Made**:
  ```typescript
  // Prioritize actual Farcaster username over display name
  const username =
    (userObj && (userObj as any).username) || // First try actual username
    (clientObj && (clientObj as any).username) ||
    (userObj && (userObj as any).displayName) || // Then display name
    (clientObj && (clientObj as any).displayName) ||
    (userObj && (userObj as any).name) || // Finally name
    (clientObj && (clientObj as any).name);
  ```
- **Result**: ✅ Now properly uses actual Farcaster usernames when available

**TypeScript Compilation Fixes**:

- Fixed linter errors related to OnchainKit type definitions
- Added proper type casting for Farcaster-specific properties
- All TypeScript errors resolved

**Status**: ✅ Both issues resolved. Profile navigation working and Farcaster usernames properly extracted.

### 🔧 **CRITICAL FIX - Spend Permission Button Logic Corrected - COMPLETED**

**Issue**: Farcaster users were getting routed to Coinbase spend permissions instead of ERC20 approve when clicking "Approve Spend"

**Root Cause Analysis**:

- The `hasFarcasterContext` detection was not reliable in all scenarios
- Some Farcaster users were being incorrectly identified as wallet-only users
- This caused them to use Coinbase spend permissions instead of ERC20 approve

**Solution Implemented**:

1. **Enhanced Farcaster Detection**: Added comprehensive debugging and improved detection logic

   ```typescript
   // Alternative detection: if user has fid in profile, they're a Farcaster user
   const isFarcasterUser = hasFarcasterContext || (profile && profile.fid);
   ```

2. **Updated Button Logic**: Changed from `hasFarcasterContext` to `isFarcasterUser`

   - **Farcaster Users**: Now reliably use `handleFarcasterApproval` (ERC20 approve)
   - **Wallet-Only Users**: Use `handleApproveSpend` (Coinbase spend permissions)

3. **Added Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging to track user type determination

   ```typescript
   console.log('[Profile] Final user type determination:', {
     hasFarcasterContext,
     profileHasFid: profile?.fid,
     isFarcasterUser,
     willUseERC20: isFarcasterUser
   });
   ```

4. **Updated All References**: Changed button logic, error handling, and useEffect to use `isFarcasterUser`

**Files Modified**:

- `app/profile/page.tsx` - Updated user type detection and button logic

**Expected Behavior**:

- ✅ Farcaster users will now always get "Approve ERC20 Spend Permission" button
- ✅ ERC20 approve function will be called for all Farcaster users
- ✅ Debug logs will show user type determination process
- ✅ No more accidental routing to Coinbase spend permissions for Farcaster users

**Test Instructions**:

1. Open profile page as Farcaster user
2. Check console logs for user type determination
3. Verify button shows "Approve ERC20 Spend Permission"
4. Click button and verify it calls ERC20 approve, not Coinbase spend permissions

**Status**: ✅ **CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED** - Farcaster users now correctly use ERC20 approve

### 🔧 **Multiple User Creation in Wallet Context Fix - COMPLETED**

**Issue**: The app was generating multiple users when in wallet context, causing duplicate user records

**Root Cause Analysis**:

- The wallet-only user effect had a race condition between Farcaster context loading and wallet connection
- The effect was running multiple times as the context changed, causing duplicate user creation attempts
- The `context` was in the dependency array, causing the effect to re-run whenever context updated

**Solution Implemented**:

1. **Added Farcaster Context Check State**: Added `farcasterContextChecked` state to track when context has been fully evaluated

   ```typescript
   const [farcasterContextChecked, setFarcasterContextChecked] = useState(false);
   ```

2. **Updated Farcaster Effect**: Modified the Farcaster context effect to mark when context has been checked

   ```typescript
   // Always mark that we've checked Farcaster context (even if null)
   if (!farcasterContextChecked) {
     setFarcasterContextChecked(true);
   }
   ```

3. **Fixed Wallet-Only Effect**: Updated the wallet-only user effect to only run after Farcaster context has been checked

   ```typescript
   // Only proceed if Farcaster context has been checked (to avoid race conditions)
   if (!isConnected || !walletAddress || user || userLoading || !farcasterContextChecked) {
     return;
   }
   ```

4. **Proper Dependency Management**: Added `farcasterContextChecked` and `context` to the wallet-only effect dependencies

**Files Modified**:

- `providers/UserProvider.tsx` - Fixed race condition and multiple user creation

**Expected Behavior**:

- ✅ Wallet-only users will only be created once per session
- ✅ No more duplicate user records in wallet context
- ✅ Proper separation between Farcaster and wallet-only user flows
- ✅ Race condition between context loading and wallet connection resolved

**Debug Output to Expect**:

```
[UserProvider] Farcaster context: null
[UserProvider] context is null or undefined. Skipping Farcaster user extraction.
[UserProvider] No Farcaster context, creating wallet-only user for address: 0x...
[UserProvider] Creating/fetching user with payload: {walletAddress: "0x..."}
```

**Status**: ✅ **CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED** - Multiple user creation in wallet context fixed

### Recently Completed

- **Love/Tip Revert Issue Fix**: Fixed the issue where clicking "love" on a chapter would update the tip count but then revert back to the previous number. The problem was that `fetchChapter` was being called after user state changes and was overriding the optimistic tip count update. Implemented a timestamp-based solution using `recentTipTimestampRef` to prevent `fetchChapter` from overriding the tip count within 5 seconds of a successful tip operation.

- **ERC20 Approval Signature Storage Fix**: Fixed the issue where Farcaster users' ERC20 approvals were storing the hardcoded string `"erc20_approved"` instead of the actual transaction hash. The problem was in the post-approval logic where `spendPermissionSignature` was being set to a static string instead of using the `approveTxHash` from the blockchain transaction. Now properly stores the actual transaction hash for verification and audit purposes.
