# Background and Motivation

Asterion is a Farcaster mini app for reading and tipping web novels. We have a backend API endpoint (`/api/users`) that checks if a user exists (by Farcaster `fid` or `username`) and creates the user if not. We want to ensure that when a Farcaster user launches the Mini App, the app calls this endpoint to guarantee the user is present in the database, enabling seamless onboarding and data association for tipping, bookmarks, etc.

**Update:**

- Users want to grant spend permissions for USDC (on Base) only. ETH support is not required.
- Spend limit should be a single adjustable value (not daily or monthly).

**NEW FEATURE - Wallet-Username Association:**

The app now needs to support wallet-only users (those who connect via Coinbase Smart Wallet but don't have Farcaster accounts). When a user connects their wallet:

1. Check if the wallet address is already associated with a username in the database
2. If not, generate a random username and save it along with the wallet address
3. Ensure seamless integration with existing user management system
4. Support both Farcaster users (with fid/username) and wallet-only users (with address/generated username)
5. **NEW REQUIREMENT**: For existing users (Farcaster or wallet-based) who don't have a `walletAddress` field populated, detect their current connected wallet and update their user record with the wallet address

**NEW FEATURE - Data Caching & Performance:**

The app needs to implement proper data caching to prevent unnecessary reloads when navigating between pages. Currently, users experience slow loading when returning to the homepage from novel details pages. The solution is to implement SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate) for:

1. Caching novels list data across page navigations
2. Caching individual novel details for faster subsequent loads
3. Caching chapter data to prevent refetching
4. Optimizing user experience with background revalidation
5. Reducing API calls and improving perceived performance

**NEW FEATURE - Line-Level Reading Progress Tracking:**

Users want to be able to resume reading exactly where they left off, down to the specific line within a chapter. This feature will:

1. Track the exact line number where the user stopped reading in each chapter
2. Save reading progress automatically as the user scrolls through chapters
3. Provide a "Resume Reading" option that jumps to the exact line
4. Show reading progress indicators (e.g., "45% complete", "Line 127 of 234")
5. Maintain reading history across devices and sessions
6. Handle different screen sizes and text wrapping scenarios
7. Provide visual indicators of reading progress in chapter lists and novel details

# Key Challenges and Analysis

- **Where to Trigger:** The logic should run as soon as the Farcaster user context is available (from MiniKit/Farcaster context), ideally in a provider or onboarding effect.
- **User Data:** We need to extract the user's `fid` and `username` from the Farcaster context (via `useMiniKit`).
- **API Call:** The frontend should POST to `/api/users` with the `fid` and `username`.
- **Idempotency:** The endpoint is idempotent (find or create), so repeated calls are safe.
- **Error Handling:** Handle errors gracefully and provide debug output if user creation fails.
- **Testing:** Ensure the logic works with both new and existing users.

**Update:**

- **USDC Token Address:** Need to add the USDC token address for Base (0xd9aAC23E6A83242c5d306341aCfD7A71A9C6e7B0).
- **SpendPermission UI:** The UI and logic must grant permission for USDC only (no ETH option).
- **Persistence:** User-selected limits should persist (localStorage, DB, or context).
- **UX:** The UI should clearly show the current limits and that USDC is the only supported token.

**NEW CHALLENGES - Wallet-Username Association:**

- **Database Schema:** Need to add `walletAddress` field to User model to support wallet-only users
- **Dual Authentication:** Support both Farcaster-based authentication (fid/username) and wallet-based authentication (address/generated username)
- **Username Generation:** Implement random username generation algorithm that creates unique, readable usernames
- **Conflict Resolution:** Handle cases where a generated username might already exist
- **User Provider Logic:** Extend UserProvider to detect wallet connections and create/fetch wallet-based users
- **API Endpoint Updates:** Modify `/api/users` to handle wallet address lookup and user creation
- **Uniqueness Constraints:** Ensure wallet addresses are unique in the database while maintaining existing username uniqueness
- **Backward Compatibility:** Ensure existing Farcaster users continue to work without issues
- **Existing User Address Updates:** For existing users without `walletAddress`, detect and update their records when they connect a wallet
- **Address Validation:** Ensure the same wallet address isn't associated with multiple users (handle conflicts gracefully)
- **Migration Logic:** Handle scenarios where existing users connect wallets for the first time

**NEW CHALLENGES - Data Caching & Performance:**

- **SWR Integration:** Implement SWR hooks for all major data fetching operations
- **Cache Configuration:** Configure appropriate cache durations for different data types (novels: 1min, individual novels: 5min, chapters: 3min)
- **Provider Setup:** Set up SWR provider with global configuration for offline handling, retry logic, and deduplication
- **State Migration:** Replace existing useState/useEffect data fetching with SWR hooks
- **Error Handling:** Implement proper error boundaries and fallback states for SWR
- **Background Revalidation:** Configure when and how data should be revalidated in the background
- **Optimistic Updates:** Implement optimistic updates for actions like bookmarking and tipping
- **Performance Monitoring:** Ensure SWR implementation actually improves performance metrics

**NEW CHALLENGES - Line-Level Reading Progress Tracking:**

- **Database Schema:** Need to add ReadingProgress model to track user's reading position per chapter
- **Line Detection:** Implement reliable line counting that works across different screen sizes and text wrapping
- **Scroll Tracking:** Track user's scroll position and determine which line is currently visible
- **Auto-Save Logic:** Implement debounced auto-save to prevent excessive API calls while reading
- **Progress Calculation:** Calculate reading percentage based on current line vs total lines in chapter
- **Resume Functionality:** Implement smooth scrolling to resume reading at exact line position
- **Performance Impact:** Ensure progress tracking doesn't affect reading experience or performance
- **Cross-Device Sync:** Maintain reading progress across different devices and screen sizes
- **Text Rendering:** Handle dynamic text rendering and ensure consistent line numbering
- **Visual Indicators:** Design and implement progress indicators in UI components
- **Offline Support:** Handle reading progress when user is offline and sync when back online

# Current Status / Progress Tracking

## Latest Updates (Line-Level Reading Progress Tracking)

**✅ COMPLETED - Core Reading Progress Tracking Implementation + Bug Fix**

I have successfully implemented the core line-level reading progress tracking feature and resolved the critical error that was preventing the "Read Now" button from working.

### 🐛 Bug Fix - ChapterReader Component Error

**Issue**: When clicking "Read Now", the app was throwing an error:

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')
```

**Root Cause**: The `handleLove` useCallback was trying to access `currentChapter.id` and `user.id` in its dependency array before these objects were properly loaded.

**Solution**:

- Added proper null checks at the beginning of the `handleLove` function
- Updated dependency arrays to use optional chaining (`currentChapter?.id`, `user?.id`)
- Added similar null checks to the `debouncedSave` function
- Ensured all functions handle undefined states gracefully

**Status**: ✅ FIXED - The ChapterReader component now properly handles loading states and the "Read Now" button works correctly.

# Lessons

- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command
- **NEW LESSON**: When implementing complex features with multiple dependencies (like Prisma models), always add proper null checks and optional chaining in React components to handle loading states gracefully.
- **NEW LESSON**: When useCallback dependency arrays reference object properties, use optional chaining (object?.property) to prevent undefined access errors during component initialization.
- **NEW LESSON**: After adding new Prisma models, always run `npx prisma generate` and `npx prisma db push` to ensure the client and database are properly updated.
