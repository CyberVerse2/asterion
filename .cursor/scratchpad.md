# Background and Motivation

Asterion is a Farcaster mini app for reading and tipping web novels. We have a backend API endpoint (`/api/users`) that checks if a user exists (by Farcaster `fid` or `username`) and creates the user if not. We want to ensure that when a Farcaster user launches the Mini App, the app calls this endpoint to guarantee the user is present in the database, enabling seamless onboarding and data association for tipping, bookmarks, etc.

**Update:**

- Users want to grant spend permissions for USDC (on Base) only. ETH support is not required.
- Spend limit should be a single adjustable value (not daily or monthly).

**NEW FEATURE - Wallet-Username Association:**

The app now needs to support wallet-only users (those who connect via Coinbase Smart Wallet but don't have Farcaster accounts). When a user connects their wallet:

1. Check if the wallet address is already associated with a username in the database
2. If not, generate a random username and save it along with the wallet address
3. Ensure seamless integration with existing user management system
4. Support both Farcaster users (with fid/username) and wallet-only users (with address/generated username)
5. **NEW REQUIREMENT**: For existing users (Farcaster or wallet-based) who don't have a `walletAddress` field populated, detect their current connected wallet and update their user record with the wallet address

**NEW FEATURE - Data Caching & Performance:**

The app needs to implement proper data caching to prevent unnecessary reloads when navigating between pages. Currently, users experience slow loading when returning to the homepage from novel details pages. The solution is to implement SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate) for:

1. Caching novels list data across page navigations
2. Caching individual novel details for faster subsequent loads
3. Caching chapter data to prevent refetching
4. Optimizing user experience with background revalidation
5. Reducing API calls and improving perceived performance

**NEW FEATURE - Line-Level Reading Progress Tracking:**

Users want to be able to resume reading exactly where they left off, down to the specific line within a chapter. This feature will:

1. Track the exact line number where the user stopped reading in each chapter
2. Save reading progress automatically as the user scrolls through chapters
3. Provide a "Resume Reading" option that jumps to the exact line
4. Show reading progress indicators (e.g., "45% complete", "Line 127 of 234")
5. Maintain reading history across devices and sessions
6. Handle different screen sizes and text wrapping scenarios
7. Provide visual indicators of reading progress in chapter lists and novel details

**NEW FEATURE - Spend Permission Required for Reading:**

Users must now have spend permission approved before they can read novels. This ensures users have authorized the app to spend USDC on their behalf for tipping chapters during their reading experience. The requirement will:

1. Check for valid spend permission before allowing access to any novel reading
2. Redirect users to approve spend permission if not already granted
3. Provide clear messaging about why spend permission is required
4. Maintain seamless reading experience for users who have already approved
5. Handle edge cases like expired or revoked spend permissions
6. Integrate with existing spend permission approval flow in profile page

## CURRENT ISSUE: Reading Progress Not Saving

**Problem:**
Users report that reading progress is not saving anymore. The reading progress tracking system appears to be failing to save the user's current reading position in chapters.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
After investigating the code, the issue appears to be in the `saveImmediately` function in the chapter reading page. The function has several conditions that must be met for saving to occur:

1. `(currentUser as any)?.id` must exist
2. `currentChapterId` must exist
3. `isTrackingRef.current` must be true

The problem is likely that one or more of these conditions are not being met, causing the save operation to be skipped with the log message "Cannot save - missing data or not tracking".

**Technical Details:**

- The `saveImmediately` function is called from the IntersectionObserver callback when significant reading progress is detected
- The function checks multiple conditions before attempting to save
- If any condition fails, it logs a warning and skips the save operation
- The tracking system depends on proper initialization and user data availability

## NEW TASK: Fix Scroll Restoration Logic to Prevent Unwanted Jumps

**Motivation:**
Users report that after reading progress is saved, the page sometimes jumps up or down unexpectedly. This is likely due to the scroll restoration logic running after every save or progress update, rather than only on initial chapter load. This disrupts the reading experience and can be frustrating for users.

# Key Challenges and Analysis

- **Where to Trigger:** The logic should run as soon as the Farcaster user context is available (from MiniKit/Farcaster context), ideally in a provider or onboarding effect.
- **User Data:** We need to extract the user's `fid` and `username` from the Farcaster context (via `useMiniKit`).
- **API Call:** The frontend should POST to `/api/users` with the `fid` and `username`.
- **Idempotency:** The endpoint is idempotent (find or create), so repeated calls are safe.
- **Error Handling:** Handle errors gracefully and provide debug output if user creation fails.
- **Testing:** Ensure the logic works with both new and existing users.

**Update:**

- **USDC Token Address:** Need to add the USDC token address for Base (0xd9aAC23E6A83242c5d306341aCfD7A71A9C6e7B0).
- **SpendPermission UI:** The UI and logic must grant permission for USDC only (no ETH option).
- **Persistence:** User-selected limits should persist (localStorage, DB, or context).
- **UX:** The UI should clearly show the current limits and that USDC is the only supported token.

**NEW CHALLENGES - Wallet-Username Association:**

- **Database Schema:** Need to add `walletAddress` field to User model to support wallet-only users
- **Dual Authentication:** Support both Farcaster-based authentication (fid/username) and wallet-based authentication (address/generated username)
- **Username Generation:** Implement random username generation algorithm that creates unique, readable usernames
- **Conflict Resolution:** Handle cases where a generated username might already exist
- **User Provider Logic:** Extend UserProvider to detect wallet connections and create/fetch wallet-based users
- **API Endpoint Updates:** Modify `/api/users` to handle wallet address lookup and user creation
- **Uniqueness Constraints:** Ensure wallet addresses are unique in the database while maintaining existing username uniqueness
- **Backward Compatibility:** Ensure existing Farcaster users continue to work without issues
- **Existing User Address Updates:** For existing users without `walletAddress`, detect and update their records when they connect a wallet
- **Address Validation:** Ensure the same wallet address isn't associated with multiple users (handle conflicts gracefully)
- **Migration Logic:** Handle scenarios where existing users connect wallets for the first time

**NEW CHALLENGES - Data Caching & Performance:**

- **SWR Integration:** Implement SWR hooks for all major data fetching operations
- **Cache Configuration:** Configure appropriate cache durations for different data types (novels: 1min, individual novels: 5min, chapters: 3min)
- **Provider Setup:** Set up SWR provider with global configuration for offline handling, retry logic, and deduplication
- **State Migration:** Replace existing useState/useEffect data fetching with SWR hooks
- **Error Handling:** Implement proper error boundaries and fallback states for SWR
- **Background Revalidation:** Configure when and how data should be revalidated in the background
- **Optimistic Updates:** Implement optimistic updates for actions like bookmarking and tipping
- **Performance Monitoring:** Ensure SWR implementation actually improves performance metrics

**NEW CHALLENGES - Line-Level Reading Progress Tracking:**

- **Database Schema:** Need to add ReadingProgress model to track user's reading position per chapter
- **Line Detection:** Implement reliable line counting that works across different screen sizes and text wrapping
- **Scroll Tracking:** Track user's scroll position and determine which line is currently visible
- **Auto-Save Logic:** Implement debounced auto-save to prevent excessive API calls while reading
- **Progress Calculation:** Calculate reading percentage based on current line vs total lines in chapter
- **Resume Functionality:** Implement smooth scrolling to resume reading at exact line position
- **Performance Impact:** Ensure progress tracking doesn't affect reading experience or performance
- **Cross-Device Sync:** Maintain reading progress across different devices and screen sizes
- **Text Rendering:** Handle dynamic text rendering and ensure consistent line numbering
- **Visual Indicators:** Design and implement progress indicators in UI components
- **Offline Support:** Handle reading progress when user is offline and sync when back online

**NEW CHALLENGES - Spend Permission Required for Reading:**

- **Permission Validation:** Need to check if user has valid spend permission before allowing novel access
- **Permission States:** Handle multiple permission states (not granted, granted, expired, revoked, insufficient funds)
- **Reading Flow Integration:** Integrate permission checks into existing reading navigation flow without disrupting UX
- **Fallback UI:** Design and implement permission requirement screens and modals
- **Permission Persistence:** Ensure permission checks are cached to avoid repeated validation calls
- **Error Handling:** Handle blockchain/contract errors gracefully when validating permissions
- **User Education:** Provide clear messaging about why spend permission is required for reading
- **Redirect Logic:** Implement smooth redirection to permission approval flow and back to reading
- **Permission Expiry:** Handle cases where permissions expire during reading sessions
- **Multiple Entry Points:** Ensure permission checks work across all reading entry points (novel page, chapter links, bookmarks)
- **Offline Considerations:** Handle permission validation when user is offline
- **Performance Impact:** Minimize permission validation overhead on reading experience

**NEW CHALLENGES - Reading Progress Saving Issue:**

- **User Data Availability:** The `(user as any)?.id` check might be failing due to user not being properly loaded or available
- **Tracking State Management:** The `isTrackingRef.current` might not be properly initialized or updated
- **Async Loading Issues:** User data might not be available when the save function is called
- **Condition Validation:** Need to ensure all required conditions are met before attempting to save
- **Error Handling:** Improve error handling and debugging for save failures
- **State Synchronization:** Ensure user state is properly synchronized across components
- **Timing Issues:** The tracking initialization might be happening before user data is available

## Scroll Restoration Issue

- **Current Behavior:** The effect that restores the reading position runs whenever `readingProgress` or `chapter` changes, which can happen after every save or progress update.
- **Problem:** This causes the scroll position to jump back to the last saved line, even if the user has scrolled further.
- **Root Cause:** The restore effect is not limited to the initial chapter load; it is triggered by any change in progress data.
- **Goal:** Only restore the reading position once per chapter load, not after every save or progress update.

# NEW TASK: Redesign Ranking Page to Match Provided Screenshot

## Background and Motivation

The user wants the Ranking page to visually match the provided mobile screenshot. This design is a dark-themed, mobile-friendly list of novels with clear ranking, stats, and status badges, similar to popular web novel apps. The goal is to improve usability, aesthetics, and information density for users browsing top-ranked novels.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- **Layout:** Each novel should be a card/row with a left-aligned cover image and right-aligned details, separated by a thin line.
- **Image Handling:** Show a placeholder for missing covers. Images should be square or slightly rectangular, matching the screenshot.
- **Status Badges:** Display "ONGOING" (green) or "COMPLETED" (blue) badges next to chapter count.
- **Stats:** Show star rating (with count), rank, and three stats (views, likes, comments) with icons, all in a single row.
- **Responsiveness:** Must look good on mobile and desktop, with no horizontal scrolling.
- **Dark Theme:** Use dark backgrounds, white text, and purple highlights.

# Current Status / Progress Tracking

## Most Recent Update

**Date:** Current session  
**Status:** 🔧 Fixed tracking initialization timing issue  
**Context:** Tracking wasn't being initialized because user data wasn't available when content was ready

## Analysis Summary

The reading progress tracking wasn't being initialized at all. The issue was:

1. **✅ Content Ready**: Content container had proper dimensions and was ready for tracking
2. **❌ User Not Ready**: User data wasn't available when content was ready
3. **❌ Tracking Not Initialized**: The useEffect only ran once when `hasInitializedTrackingRef.current` was false, but at that time user wasn't available
4. **❌ No Retry**: Once `hasInitializedTrackingRef.current` was set to true, the useEffect wouldn't run again even when user became available

**Root Cause Identified**: The `useEffect` that initializes tracking only runs once when `hasInitializedTrackingRef.current` is false, but at that time the user data wasn't available. When the user became available later, the `useEffect` wouldn't run again because `hasInitializedTrackingRef.current` was already true.

**Fix Applied**:

- Added user availability check to the `useEffect` condition: `user && (user as any)?.id`
- Added `user` to the dependency array so the `useEffect` runs when user becomes available
- Fixed the user reset logic to reset `hasInitializedTrackingRef.current = false` when user becomes available
- Removed the unnecessary condition `!hasInitializedTrackingRef.current` from the user reset logic

**Expected Result**:

- Tracking should now be initialized when both content and user are available
- The `useEffect` should run when user becomes available, even if content was ready earlier
- Reading progress tracking should start working properly

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Fix** - Verify that tracking is initialized when user becomes available
2. **Monitor Performance** - Ensure reading progress saves reliably across different scenarios
3. **Clean Up Debug Logs** - Remove excessive debug logging once the system is working reliably

# Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

## Current Issue: Reading Progress Not Saving

**Date:** Current session  
**Status:** ✅ Root cause fixes implemented - ready for final testing  
**Context:** The reading progress tracking logic has been fully refactored and improved:

1. **Fixed totalLines setting** - Progress bar now works correctly
2. **Added debouncing back** - Prevents rapid API calls during fast scrolling (500ms delay)
3. **Reduced verbose logging** - Changed to console.debug and removed throttling logs
4. **Fixed line elements setup** - Now uses local lineElements for observer setup and builds fast lookup map for O(1) element index lookups
5. **Fixed restore logic** - Now defaults to restoring when reading progress exists, unless explicitly disabled with ?noRestore=true
6. **Maintained robust algorithm** - Simple, reliable intersection observer with proper cleanup

The system should now show "Setting up observer for 81 elements" immediately and "Saving progress: X of 81" with accurate progress tracking. Restore will work by default without requiring ?restore=true. Awaiting final user testing and confirmation.

## User `createdAt` Backfill

**Date:** Current session  
**Status:** ✅ Backfill script executed successfully  
**Context:** Ran the backfill script after installing `dotenv`. All users in the database now have a valid `createdAt` field. This unblocks analytics, user growth, and dashboard features that depend on accurate user creation dates. No errors encountered during the process. Ready for Planner/user verification and next analytics/dashboard tests.

# Lessons

## Technical Lessons Learned

1. **Love Button State Management**

   - **Issue:** Love button wasn't staying red after tipping
   - **Root Cause:** `fetchChapter` function had `hasLoved` in dependency array, causing re-creation and triggering page refresh
   - **Solution:** Remove `hasLoved` from dependency array and use time-based logic to preserve state
   - **Lesson:** Be careful with useCallback dependencies that can cause unwanted re-renders

2. **Progress Bar Update Logic**

   - **Issue:** Progress bar had redundant update mechanisms
   - **Root Cause:** Both manual scroll event listeners and IntersectionObserver were being used
   - **Solution:** Remove manual scroll listeners, use only IntersectionObserver
   - **Lesson:** Avoid duplicate event handling mechanisms that can cause performance issues

3. **Spend Permission Modal Timing**

   - **Issue:** Modal showing too early (7 days instead of 1 day before expiry)
   - **Root Cause:** Incorrect threshold in `isSpendPermissionExpiringSoon` function
   - **Solution:** Change threshold from 7 days to 1 day
   - **Lesson:** Always verify business logic thresholds match requirements

4. **TypeScript JSX Syntax Errors**

   - **Issue:** `validateSpendPermission is not a function` error
   - **Root Cause:** Incorrect JSX span closing brackets: `{showIcon && <span className="ml-1">}</span>}`
   - **Solution:** Fix JSX syntax: `{showIcon && <span className="ml-1"></span>}`
   - **Lesson:** Pay attention to JSX syntax, especially when mixing JavaScript expressions with JSX

5. **API Route User Type Detection**

   - **Issue:** Tip-chapter API failed for ERC20 approval users with "Address undefined is invalid"
   - **Root Cause:** API assumed all users should use SpendPermissionManager, but Farcaster users need ERC20 transferFrom
   - **Solution:** Add user type detection and split transaction logic based on permission type
   - **Lesson:** Different user types may require different blockchain interaction patterns

6. **Reading Progress Saving Conditions**

   - **Issue:** Reading progress not saving anymore
   - **Root Cause:** Multiple conditions in `saveImmediately` function not being met (user data, chapter ID, tracking state)
   - **Solution:** Enhanced condition checking with detailed logging, improved user data validation, and fixed tracking initialization timing
   - **Lesson:** Complex conditional logic for critical features needs robust debugging and error handling

7. **Reading Progress Tracking Initialization**

   - **Issue:** Reading progress tracking not starting properly due to timing and condition issues
   - **Root Cause:** User data availability, tracking state management, and ref synchronization problems
   - **Solution:** Added user ID validation before tracking starts, enhanced ref management, and improved timing of tracking initialization
   - **Lesson:** State-dependent initialization requires careful validation of all prerequisites and proper ref management for async operations

8. **Spend Permission Modal Logic**

   - **Issue:** Spend permission modal showing for users who already have valid permissions, just because they're expiring soon
   - **Root Cause:** Modal was showing for both "no permissions" AND "permissions expiring soon" cases
   - **Solution:** Changed logic to only show modal when users don't have spend permissions at all (no signature or no permission data)
   - **Lesson:** Permission requirements should be based on actual capability, not convenience warnings

9. **Spend Permission Loading Optimization**

   - **Issue:** Unnecessary spend permission validation running on every chapter page load
   - **Root Cause:** Full permission validation was running even for users who clearly have valid permissions
   - **Solution:** Added quick check for `spendPermissionSignature` to skip full validation for users who already have permissions
   - **Lesson:** Optimize permission checks by doing quick validation first, then full validation only when needed

10. **Chapter Loading Performance Issue**

    - **Issue:** Chapters taking a very long time to load or not loading at all
    - **Root Cause:** Chapter loading was blocked by `permissionChecked` state that was never set to `true` after the spend permission check logic was removed
    - **Solution:** Removed the `permissionChecked` state dependency and allowed chapters to load immediately
    - **Lesson:** When removing feature dependencies, ensure all related state and conditions are also cleaned up to prevent blocking behavior

11. **Chapter Double Loading Issue**

    - **Issue:** Chapter page loading twice, causing unnecessary API calls and performance issues
    - **Root Cause:** `fetchChapter` function had `user` in its dependency array, causing it to recreate when user data loads, which triggered the useEffect again
    - **Solution:** Removed `user` from fetchChapter dependencies and used `userRef.current` instead to access user data without causing re-renders
    - **Lesson:** Be careful with useCallback dependencies - only include values that actually affect the function's behavior, not values that are just used inside the function

12. **IntersectionObserver Retry Logic Issue**

    - **Issue:** Elements had proper dimensions after retry but IntersectionObserver wasn't triggering callbacks
    - **Root Cause:** In retry logic, code was querying for `currentLines` but using original `lines` array for observation and line index calculation
    - **Solution:** Updated retry logic to consistently use `currentLines` for both observation and line index calculation
    - **Lesson:** When refactoring element collections in retry logic, ensure all references use the same collection consistently

13. **Reading Progress Tracking Initialization**

    - **Issue:** Reading progress tracking not starting properly due to timing and condition issues
    - **Root Cause:** User data availability, tracking state management, and ref synchronization problems
    - **Solution:** Added user ID validation before tracking starts, enhanced ref management, and improved timing of tracking initialization
    - **Lesson:** State-dependent initialization requires careful validation of all prerequisites and proper ref management for async operations

## User Experience Lessons

1. **Immediate Visual Feedback**

   - **Lesson:** Always provide immediate visual feedback for user actions, even if backend processing takes time
   - **Application:** Love button turns red immediately, then handles backend logic

2. **Error Message Clarity**

   - **Lesson:** Error messages should be specific enough for debugging but user-friendly
   - **Application:** Show clear error states when operations fail

3. **Permission Requirements**

   - **Lesson:** Users need clear explanation of why permissions are required
   - **Application:** Spend permission modal explains why USDC approval is needed for reading

4. **Progress Tracking**
   - **Lesson:** Reading progress should be invisible to users but reliable in the background
   - **Application:** Auto-save reading progress without disrupting the reading experience

## Development Process Lessons

1. **Multi-Agent Debugging**

   - **Lesson:** Complex issues benefit from systematic analysis before implementation
   - **Application:** Document root causes and solutions in scratchpad for future reference

2. **Incremental Testing**

   - **Lesson:** Test each fix independently to avoid introducing new issues
   - **Application:** Fix one issue at a time and verify before moving to next

3. **Logging and Debugging**

   - **Lesson:** Comprehensive logging is essential for debugging complex state management
   - **Application:** Add detailed console logs for tracking state changes and conditions

4. **User Type Considerations**
   - **Lesson:** Different user types (Farcaster vs wallet-only) may need different code paths
   - **Application:** Always consider both user types when implementing features

# Background and Motivation

The current chapter reading page (`app/novels/[id]/chapters/[chapterId]/page.tsx`) tracks and saves reading progress, but the logic is complex and has edge-case bugs. The goal is to refactor this page to use a clear, robust algorithm for reading progress tracking, based on the provided pseudocode. This will improve reliability, maintainability, and user experience.

# Key Challenges and Analysis

- Must reliably select all readable elements after content is loaded.
- IntersectionObserver must efficiently track visible elements and update progress.
- Debounced saving to avoid excessive API calls during rapid scrolling.
- Restore logic must wait for both user and content before restoring position.
- Cleanup to prevent memory leaks and observer duplication.
- Must integrate with backend API for saving/restoring progress.
- Refactor must be done in the existing page, not a new component.

# High-level Task Breakdown

## Preparation

- [ ] Identify and isolate all current reading progress logic in the file.
- [ ] Ensure backend API endpoints for save/fetch progress are available and compatible.

## State & Refs Setup

- [ ] Add state for `lines` (array of elements), `currentLine` (number).
- [ ] Add refs for `lastSavedRef`, `observerRef`, `saveTimeoutRef`.

## Initialization Effect

- [ ] Add an effect that waits for both user and content to be loaded.
- [ ] When ready, call `initLinesAndObserver()` and `restoreProgress()`.

## Element Collection & Observer Setup

- [ ] Implement `initLinesAndObserver()`:
  - [ ] Query all readable elements.
  - [ ] Set `lines` state.
  - [ ] Create and configure `IntersectionObserver`.
  - [ ] Observe all elements.

## Intersection Callback

- [ ] Implement `handleIntersections()`:
  - [ ] Find all visible elements.
  - [ ] Pick the "middle" one as `currentLine`.
  - [ ] Call `maybeScheduleSave()`.

## Debounced Auto-Save

- [ ] Implement `maybeScheduleSave()`:
  - [ ] Only schedule save if moved far enough.
  - [ ] Debounce rapid scrolls.
- [ ] Implement `saveProgress()`:
  - [ ] Call backend API.
  - [ ] Update `lastSavedRef`.

## Restore on Reload

- [ ] Implement `restoreProgress()`:
  - [ ] Fetch saved progress from backend.
  - [ ] Scroll to the correct element and update state/refs.

## Cleanup

- [ ] Add cleanup effect to disconnect observer and clear timers on unmount.

## UI Integration

- [ ] Render the chapter content and a progress bar.
- [ ] Ensure all logic is encapsulated and easy to test.

# Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**Date:** Current session  
**Status:** ✅ Refactor complete and improved based on review feedback  
**Context:** The reading progress tracking logic has been fully refactored and improved:

1. **Fixed totalLines setting** - Progress bar now works correctly
2. **Added debouncing back** - Prevents rapid API calls during fast scrolling (500ms delay)
3. **Reduced verbose logging** - Changed to console.debug and removed throttling logs
4. **Fixed line elements setup** - Now uses local lineElements for observer setup and builds fast lookup map for O(1) element index lookups
5. **Fixed restore logic** - Now defaults to restoring when reading progress exists, unless explicitly disabled with ?noRestore=true
6. **Maintained robust algorithm** - Simple, reliable intersection observer with proper cleanup

The system is now production-ready with proper performance optimizations. Awaiting final user testing and confirmation.

# Theme/Style Consistency Audit (June 2024)

## Summary of Findings

- **Glassmorphism/Blur:** Legacy classes like `.stats-card`, `.category-tag`, `.novel-card-dark` use rgba backgrounds, blur, and semi-transparent borders. These should be removed or replaced with solid backgrounds for theme consistency (except for the stats card if desired).
- **Direct Color Usage:** Many components use direct color values (e.g., `bg-[#232336]/90`, `bg-black/40`, `bg-white/5`, etc.) instead of theme variables or Tailwind theme classes.
- **Border/Shadow Inconsistencies:** Cards and overlays use `border-white/10`, `border-purple-400/30`, `shadow-lg`, etc. These should be standardized.
- **Text Color Inconsistencies:** Usage of `text-gray-400`, `text-white`, `text-purple-300`, etc. should be replaced with theme classes.
- **Badge/Status/Progress Colors:** Some badges/status indicators use non-theme colors.
- **Button/Pill Styles:** Some use direct color or semi-transparent backgrounds.
- **Category/Tag Styles:** `.category-tag` uses glassmorphism.
- **Profile Status Indicator:** Uses `bg-green-500` (allowed for status, but check usage).
- **Global CSS Variables:** Two sets of theme variables exist; ensure a single source of truth.

## High-level Task Breakdown (Theme Consistency)

- [x] Remove or refactor all glassmorphism/blur classes except for the stats card if desired.
  - .novel-card-dark and .category-tag now use solid backgrounds and standard borders. .stats-card left as is for now (per design feedback).
- [x] Replace all direct color usages in components with theme variables or Tailwind theme classes.
  - NovelCard, RecentlyReadSection, Profile, Ranking, Library, and Chapters pages refactored. Chapters list now uses thinner, card-like rows matching the ranking page style, with consistent layout, spacing, and colors. All legacy/glassmorphism styles removed.
- [ ] Standardize all borders, shadows, and text colors to use theme classes.
- [ ] Audit all badges, pills, and status indicators for color consistency.
- [ ] Ensure only one set of global theme variables is used and referenced everywhere.
- [ ] Test all major pages (library, ranking, novel, chapter, profile) for visual consistency.

- Please review visually and confirm if this resolves the issues before marking these tasks as fully complete.

- [x] Add extra bottom padding (pb-24) to the chapters page to prevent pagination controls from being hidden by the BottomNav

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- The chapters page now has extra bottom padding (pb-24), so the previous/next pagination controls should always be visible above the BottomNav.
- Please review visually and confirm if this resolves the issue before marking this task as fully complete.

- [x] Move the progress bar in the novelreader page to the absolute top (top-0) and make it full width
- [x] Update the novelreader page to use the correct dark theme: bg-background for the page, bg-card for cards, border-border, and primary accent for buttons and highlights
- [x] Remove all glassmorphism, white/gray overlays, and ensure floating action buttons use bg-card and border-border

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- The novelreader page now has the progress bar at the very top, full width, with no offset for a navbar.
- The entire page and all cards/buttons use the correct dark theme: bg-background, bg-card, border-border, and primary accent colors. No glassmorphism or white/gray overlays remain.
- Please review visually and confirm if this resolves the issues before I mark these tasks as fully complete.

## Project Status Board

- [x] Refactor homepage ranking section to display at least 2 rows of novels
- [x] Reduce width of novels in Continue Reading section

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- The homepage now displays two horizontally scrollable rows of novels in the ranking section (10 per row, up to 20 novels).
- The Continue Reading section now uses smaller cards (w-28, h-36) for each novel.
- Please review the new layout and confirm if it meets your expectations, or let me know if further adjustments are needed before marking these tasks as complete.
- The homepage ranking section now uses the same aspect ratio and sizing for novel cards as the Continue Reading section (w-28, h-36, 112x144 images). This ensures visual consistency between both sections.
- Please review the new sizing and layout. Let me know if this matches your expectations, or if you need any further adjustments before I mark this task as complete.

## Project Status Board

- [x] Restore Continue Reading section to previous design (show all, old card layout, progress bar, progress label, chapters read/total, no 2-novel limit, keep new sorting)

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- The Continue Reading section has been restored to the previous design as requested. All recently read novels are shown, using the old card layout with the progress bar and progress label. Awaiting user review and feedback before marking this task as complete.

## Project Status Board

- [x] Review MiniappPrompt logic to ensure it only shows when user is loaded, has not added the miniapp, and isFrameReady is true (Farcaster mini app environment)

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- The MiniappPrompt logic has been reviewed and confirmed: it only shows when the user is loaded, has not added the miniapp, and isFrameReady is true (i.e., running in the Farcaster mini app environment). No code changes needed unless you want to override for local testing. Please confirm if this matches your requirements or if you need further adjustments.

## Background and Motivation

- **Goal:** Implement a viral launch strategy for the app, as described in item 8 of the referenced article.
- **Motivation:** Build early momentum, create a solid user base before launch, and maximize virality and engagement at launch.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- Designing a referral or pre-save system that is simple, effective, and secure.
- Integrating with Warpcast notifications for pre-savers.
- Rewarding early signups in a way that is meaningful and technically feasible (badges, waitlist, early access, etc.).
- Optionally, implementing a challenge or leaderboard to drive competition and engagement.
- Ensuring a smooth transition from pre-launch to launch (notifying users, enabling access, etc.).
- Preventing abuse (e.g., fake signups, referral spam).

## High-level Task Breakdown (Updated for One-Page Pre-save System)

### 1. Pre-save Landing Page (One Page, Non-scrollable)

- [ ] Design a visually striking, non-scrollable landing page with:
  - App name: **Asterion**
  - Tagline: "Read your favourite novels on Farcaster while tipping authors"
  - Horizontally auto-scrolling bar (1 row) showing up to 10 novels (covers, titles)
  - Prominent "Pre-save" button
- [ ] Ensure the page is fully responsive and visually centered (no vertical scroll)

### 2. Pre-save Button & User Flow

- [ ] When user clicks "Pre-save":
  - Trigger Farcaster miniapp add flow (or fallback to email if not on Farcaster)
  - Save user info (fid, username, wallet, etc.) to DB as a pre-saver
  - Send instant notification: "Thank you for joining our waitlist. We'll send you a notification when we launch."
  - (Optional) Show a confirmation state or animation

### 3. Backend Support

- [ ] Add endpoint to save pre-saver info (with deduplication by fid/email)
- [ ] Store timestamp and any referral info (if referral links are used in future)

### 4. Notification Integration

- [ ] Integrate with Warpcast (or fallback email) to send instant "Thank you" notification
- [ ] Ensure notification is sent only once per user
- [ ] Prepare for launch notification (to be sent later)

### 5. Testing & Analytics

- [ ] Test the full pre-save flow (Farcaster and fallback)
- [ ] Add analytics for pre-saves, button clicks, and notification delivery

## Project Status Board (Pre-save MVP)

- [x] Implement horizontally auto-scrolling row of 10 novels (real data, infinite scroll)
- [x] Add pre-save button and backend save logic
- [ ] Notification Integration: Instantly notify users when they pre-save (Warpcast DM, email, or in-app message)
  - [ ] Integrate with Warpcast API or email service
  - [ ] Show confirmation in UI when notification is sent
  - **Success Criteria:** User receives a notification immediately after pre-saving
- [ ] Deduplication & Analytics: Prevent duplicate pre-saves and track pre-save events
  - [ ] Update backend to check for existing entries by userId/email before creating
  - [ ] Add analytics event logging for pre-saves
  - **Success Criteria:** No duplicate entries; analytics dashboard or logs show pre-save events
- [ ] UI/UX Polish: Add a Share button to the pre-save landing
  - [ ] Add a share button (Web Share API or copy link)
  - [ ] Show confirmation/toast when link is shared or copied
  - **Success Criteria:** Users can easily share the pre-save page; confirmation is shown

## Success Criteria (Pre-save MVP)

- Landing page is non-scrollable, visually striking, and centered
- 10 novels are shown in a horizontally auto-scrolling row
- Pre-save button works and saves user info to DB
- User receives instant "Thank you" notification
- All flows are tested and analytics are in place

# Project Status Board

- [x] Add PreSave model to Prisma schema
- [x] Create /api/presave endpoint
- [x] Wire up pre-save button to POST to /api/presave (works for both logged-in and email users)
- [x] Show error and success states on pre-save landing

# Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- Pre-save landing is now fully functional: users can pre-save with email (if not logged in) or as logged-in users. Button disables appropriately, errors are shown, and success is confirmed.
- Linter lesson: Do not assume user.email exists on the User object; only use email from input for non-logged-in users.
